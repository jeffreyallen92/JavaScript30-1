    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Some dude';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players);

    // now here is the problem!
    // Players got updated because "team" is a reference to the players array
    // Soooooo oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Copy';
    console.log(team2);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'New array, concat old';
    console.log(team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'yo yo';
    console.log(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Jeffrey Allen',
      age: 26
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    console.log(person); // well damn. Person is 99 even though captain was set.

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { name: 'Cap Allen', number: 20 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread    

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
